### Activities
#### Tea sipping
Maybe not most of active things to do, but if you don't mind me, I will drink some tea in my free time. I will prolly drink some coffee too, but nowadays trying to cut it a little bit off.

#### Playing on instruments
I'm trying to play something, but mostly privately. Not having enough will-power to learn something tip-top. Maybe one day I will write a song or something.

### Games
I mostly enjoy RTS and FPS games. I don't mind playing FPP puzzle games, city sims or card games.
#### Age of Empires series
Game series that I shamelessly can say that I gave probably more than 2 thousand hours to this series, and I'm not going to stop any time soon in free time. Right now mostly playing **Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition** and **Age of Empires 3 Definitive Edition**. My favorite civs are: `Portugese, Celts, Slavs` and `Spanish, Portugese, Hausa` for second and third instalment respectively.
#### Deep Rock Galactic
If I'm going to search for something that I can play with bunch of my friends in player vs enemy gamemode... then this cave and insect killing simulator is one of those games.

### Movies and TV series
I prefer short forms, but sometimes I can watch longer, episodic forms. I prefer war movies, historical drama, or just creations that are more grounded in reality or esthetically pleasing. Doesn't matter if it is animation or not.
#### War Movies
I'm big fan of *Dirty Dozen*, *Dunkirk* and *Saving Private Ryan*, even knowing that less or more they aren't fully sticking to historical realms. Besides that I will recommend movies like *Where the Iron Crosses Grow*, *Stalingrad (1993)* and *Zulu*.
#### Drama and others...
My favorites here are *Whiplash*, *Grand Budapest Hotel*, *Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind*. 
#### ...as for the series
At the moment, *Rome*, *Pacific* and *Berserk (1997)*.

### Music
#### Postpunk, New Wave etc...
Music from those genres is pretty recent addition for me. I like music made by **A Flock of Seagulls**, **Sad Lovers and Giants** and **The Sound**. 
#### Thrash Metal
I used to listen multiple bands for years, from more known groups like **Megadeth** or **Slayer**, to less known bands like **Devastation**, **Sacrifice**, **Hexenhaus** or **Obliveon**. Nowadays is rather less than more, but I like to listen some of **Dark Angel** or **Razor** if I have mood for it.
