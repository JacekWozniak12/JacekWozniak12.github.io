### Languages
#### C#
Mostly I'm using [**C#**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) for my software. I like it having static types and [**generics**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-methods) support out of the gate - which minimizes both me making mistakes on my part and also gives me ability to create more complex and robust systems quicker. Recently I was reading more about library [**System.Reflection**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection) and [**System.Attributes**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.attribute?view=net-6.0).

#### Markdown
[**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is blessing for quick documents or presentations. Paired with plugins to it can create documents with quicker, which makes writing them way more pleasant, compared to [**Latex**](https://www.latex-project.org/). Besides, with certain plugins it can be compiled to Latex, or printed into PDF or HTML structure with plugins. Besides it is used in [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is supported by [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/).

#### Others
...recently I was working with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Liquid**. I had some experiences with **Javascript**, **Java** and **C++** albeit it being minor.
