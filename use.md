### Languages
#### C#
Mostly I'm using [**C#**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) for my software. I like it having static types and [**generics**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-methods) support out of the gate - which minimizes both me making mistakes on my part and also gives me ability to create more complex and robust systems quicker. Recently I was reading more about library [**System.Reflection**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection) and [**System.Attributes**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.attribute?view=net-6.0).

#### Markdown
[**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is blessing for quick documents or presentations. Paired with plugins to it can create documents with quicker, which makes writing them way more pleasant, compared to [**Latex**](https://www.latex-project.org/). Besides, with certain plugins it can be compiled to Latex, or printed into PDF or HTML structure with plugins. Besides it is used in [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is supported by [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/).

#### Others
...recently I was working with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Liquid** (used in portfolio website). I had some experiences with **Javascript**, **Java** and **C++** albeit it being rather modest.

### Software
#### Unity

[**Link**](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)

Currently I'm using editor versions 2020 / 2021 and 2022. In most of my projects I'm using Built-in or Universal Render Pipeline. Firstly I clear them from not needed content and packages, and install those needed ones. I used custom packages like [**DOTween**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676) and [**Newtonsoft.JSON** port from Nuget](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347). Rest really depends on the project that I'm working with.

#### Visual Studio Code

[**Link**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This is my go to code editor. It runs quickly, provides almost all features that I need from my C# IDE in multiple plugins in its marketplace, and consodilates multiple tools, from C# through Markdown and Javascript support to more exotic usages, like Random-Map-Script support for Age of Empires 2.

#### Communication

Mostly I prefer using **Discord**, **Trello** and **Todoist**. **Google Docs** works fine enough if needed. I've used **Microsoft Teams**, **Skype** and **Slack** aswell. Software here really depends on project needs. As for my git services, nowadays **Fork** and git plugin for **Visual Studio Code** is good enough.

#### Others
I used **Blender**, **Gimp**, **Audacity**, **ScreenToGif**, **OBS**, **Bosca Ceoil**, **Typora** (while it was free...) depends on my needs.
