I collected my works from my past. Mostly those will be images from runtime Unity and Blender.

### Color randomization
Circa November 2020.

It was made for my first prototype of game, that was about building a castles from bricks. I finished currently on prototype where I can destroy the castle using mouse pointer, which spawns ball. For now... 

### Blender - Weapon

For this project I had multiple uv maps prepared for every single modular piece. Three in total, one main, one light and one paint UV.
